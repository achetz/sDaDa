# sDaDa
sDaDa is an open source MATLAB-based program which extracts shape dynamics and protein localization from time-lapse dual-color images of rod-shaped bacteria. 

# Installation 
Copy the files in the desired folder, and add this folder and its subfolders to the MATLAB Path (MATLAB>HOME>Set Path>Add with Subfolders…). A test dataset is provided in “sDaDa\Example dataset\”, on which the analysis can be run without changing sDaDa_script by setting the sDaDa folder as Matlab’s current folder. To run it on your own datasets, the file names and paths need to be specified within the main script, sDaDa_script.
